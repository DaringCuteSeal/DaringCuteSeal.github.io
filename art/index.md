# Where to Find my Artwork
I post my work to [Instagram](https://instagram.com/daringcuteseal) and [DeviantArt](https://deviantart.com/daringcuteseal). Check out some animations and extra stuff on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@daringcuteseal), too!

# Wallpapers
Found out that many people liked my [Gentoo wallpaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/u0cxix/what_do_you_think_about_this_wallpaper/) that I used as [an entry to Gentoo's 2022 art contest](https://bugs.gentoo.org/847928), so I made more!

You can check the catalog at [wallpapers.daringcuteseal.xyz](https://wallpapers.daringcuteseal.xyz). Some wallpapers haven't gotten a place on the catalog yet, so check out [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/DaringCuteSeal/wallpapers) for the entire collection.
