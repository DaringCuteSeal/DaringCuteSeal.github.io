I can't make super great software yet, but I have some that might be interesting. I personally use all of these, so I would continue to develop them.

<ul>
	{% for software in page.softwares %}
	
	<li>
	<a href="/software/{{ software.name | slugify }}">{{ software.name }}</a>
	<p>{{ software.desc }}</p>
	</li>

	{% endfor %}
</ul>
