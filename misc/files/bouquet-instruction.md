# Source Code
1. 20x20 assorted origami paper (6 with good sensible colors and 6 green ones)

3. Ribbon (30 cm should be enough)
4. Stem wires (6)
5. Glue or transparent tape as needed

# Compiling
## Flowers
- [Roses and calyx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zux2swfQ7t4)
- [Lilies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf9tkHVsD04&pp=ygUZb3JpZ2FtaSBsaWx5IGpvIG5ha2FzaGltYQ%3D%3D) (for the calyx, I used the rose tutorial)
- [Lotuses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhL-fnhJvbs&pp=ygUNb3JpZ2FtaSBsb3R1cw%3D%3D)

## Assembling
1. Stick the flowers to stem wires, use glue or tape if necessary.
2. Wrap the flowers ([here's a bunch of ways to do that](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o0dH5bCCfG8))
3. Yay you're done now go back to do whatever you were doing because you got no reason to read this.. ?
