Ahh, another year has passed. Welcome, 2025!

Last year was crazy—I did some remarkable things. Kinda. There are always things to be disappointed about—as how humans always been, but I'm proud of myself nevertheless! I'm really thankful for everyone who has been part of my journey last year and I'm looking forward to write even more stories together! :) I wish to find new experiences in my life, meet new people, learn a bunch of new things, try to stay persistent and also be a lil more organized X)

My biggest goal for this year is probably to try to get my draft comic, Threaded!, published. It's a lil comic that revolves around low level Linux. I think you'd like it :)

So, as usual, good luck everyone!!

# Bonus Bits

## My Holiday

Nothing special, really. I went camping again, as usual (I often do that, it's almost an annual thing). The view there is nice:

## Looking back at 2023
I have this whole time capsule thing where I dump random interesting things I may find interesting in the future. I'm supposed to open it at the very end of a year. This is the first time I'm able to open it, so I was very excited.

The problem is, I wasn't at home during the last few days of 2024 and I forgot to bring my time capsule box, so I had to open it in 2025 which is a bit disappointing. But eh, it is what it is.

The box is hilarious to say the least. I actually do not remember writing some deep messages back then. Past me gave some really supportive and constructive messages it seems like. Past me also asked about some things in the future (well, now it's now). My favorite questions from that are probably, "Do you like high school?" (oh heck yeah) and, "Did you get ranked in middle school?" (also kind of yes but not first). I also talked about my past concerns there, and it's kinda awesome seeing that the things I once worried had come to fruition and I can finally answer all those uncertainties.

My favorite thing from the box is probably this.. let's say a "handheld beach" ^o^ I don't even remember where I collected the sand, corals, and shells from, but I think it predicted something in 2024 that's sea-related (spoiler alert: [my school event](/blog/excelsior/)), ahaha.
