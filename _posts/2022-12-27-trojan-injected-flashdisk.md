A week ago, I went to a stationary store to print a document because my printer is sort of broken. I brought an 8 GB flashdisk with only one file in it ðŸ¤·. Oddly enough, the person there said that their computer has a virus in it so I probably shouldn't use a flashdisk to print my document. But I don't want to go back home to get my phone to set up the printer there so I decided to just use the flashdisk anyway.

Today, I decided to check my flashdisk on my old laptop running Artix Linuxâ€”and something strange showed up!

Yep, that's a WindowsÂ® autorun file that tells the OS what to execute automatically when you plug your flashdisk!

That's sus as hell. Here's the content of it:
```ini
[AUtoRuN]
ShEllExECUte=__\DriveMgr.exe
UseAUtoPlAY=1
```

Apparently, it executes a file inside the `__` directory. I uploaded the file to VirusTotal and...

Boom! I got a WindowsÂ® trojan. Pretty cool. I then stored it to my hard disk as a malware sample because why not.

Yeah there's nothing much about this story but it's just kinda interesting how I wanted to print a document and ended up not only getting papers but also a trojan.
