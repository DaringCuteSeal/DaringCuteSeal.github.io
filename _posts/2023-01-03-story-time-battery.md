This is a pretty old story that I suddenly remember again. I wish I had this blog back then.

From August 7, 2021 - "Battery Freakout":
> All I know is that [every] battery capacity will decrease the more you use it. Yesterday, I killed my init (OpenRC) with the command `sudo kill 1` out of curiosity, and a TERM signal apparently just shuts down my laptop normally. This morning, I tried turning on my laptop, but it won't. I charged it, and the light indicator turns red. Then, I can actually power it on. I was really confused why the battery hit 0%, but something weirder happened. My battery capacity is at 88% (2148/2417 mAh). It was previously around 38%, and I freaked out. I never calibrated my battery before, so I thought I just calibrated it by accident yesterday. But 38% to 88% is insane and impossible, so I charged the battery to 100% and check what will happen. The capacity is still at 88%! Actually my laptop can run without adapter longer than previously. Is this capacity real? IMO it's not really accurate, since my laptop is 7 years old and I haven't replaced it yet (waiting for it to go to 20%).

Basically, my [old laptop](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-g-series-laptops/lenovo-g400s-notebook) battery's charge capacity increased out of nothing. Is the capacity real? Well, maybe. It's been 1Â½ year. My old laptop's battery capacity is now at 72%. However, after a while, the battery will usually malfunction and can't be charged. Charging it for a decent amount of time will fix that.

So, if this happened to you, you're not alone.
