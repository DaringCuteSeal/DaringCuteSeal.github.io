I had the ***best*** birthday this year, now that I think about it
- First off, I actually *GOT A PRESENT* (it's been forever since I got one from my friend).
- 2 of my friends actually celebrated my birthday during recess. Keep in mind that we are in the middle of our mid-semester exam :D
- My classmates, some of my teachers, and some of my online friends *actually* remembered my birthday!
- I got (( age ++ )) written in my birthday cake
- [Oh and somebody wrote a cute shell script for me o.o](https://github.com/DaringCuteSeal/DaringCuteSeal/commit/ac3a16ec8c45f00e2b31c78f72d9b3338e952719)*

But it gets BETTER. Today, one of my close friend (she's a normal non-tech savvy person) confessed that she originally wanted to include 2 Arch Linux stickers and an Ubuntu sticker to my birthday present (WHICH IS LIKE INSANE AND IT BLEW MY MIND AWAY AND IT DEFINITELY MELTED MY HEART ü•∫). Well, the sad part is that those stickers actually somehow disappeared before my friend got to put those at my birthday gift box.. so eh yeah, I never get to see them üòÆ‚Äçüí® but just knowing that makes me feel really happy :3
