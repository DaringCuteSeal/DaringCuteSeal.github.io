excerpt: Tech division we go!

Think I'll keep it short here. My school assignments are kinda killing me right now :) So anyway, a while back (still 2025) I was inaugurated as a member of my school student council's tech division. It's this year, though. My high school has a bit different schedule compared to my middle school it turns out. We're slightly more late. Usually, in my middle school, I would have been inaugurated already by the previous year.

I'll rewind a bit though.
# The Interview

It was a normal interview. Had it like last year. The results took forever to be announced. The interview was actually scary. They literally took notes about me there, judging various aspects bout me as I speak. Except that.. somehow the teacher didn't pay attention haha. But anyways, I had prepared my strategies: pretend I love IT sooo much ;) <small>(I do, but phrase everything in a really coolâ„¢ way)</small>. And plus, I was the coordinator for tech division back in middle school so I already got free plus points.


# So Far So Good
Thankfully, this year, I don't need to actually manage the Instagram account directly. I'm just a member. I actually expected a lot less work but it turned out that I was wrong! High school student council is _dead serious_.

Ah yeah, I didn't write anything about my middle school student council experience. In a nutshell, I never got the positions I wanted. During the first year, I barely did anything meaningful and during the second year, I didn't really enjoy working with my team as the coordinator.

Okay, back to high school student council. This organization is really _dead serious_. The amount of tasks I get is actually quite decent considering I'm the only grade 10 student in the tech team (the rest are from grade 11, okay I'm proud of that). So I've done like a few designs maybe? Not too many, I'm more involved with giving feedbacks and handling events. So far it's great, we all work cooperatively together. Really nice team, I love it.


# Catch: No Website??
Here's the less exciting part of the tech team: we proposed to get a website for our student council but it was rejected. The reason? Somehow because "we already have official school site". Yet, I saw another campus of my school having a site for their student council, **written with React!!!** <small>And also by the way [our Excelsior site](https://daringcuteseal.github.io/blog/excelsior/) exists</small>. How is that fair? Back in middle school I got to make one. [It's here, by the way (in Indonesian).](https://osisphi.wordprses.com)
Depending on my future outlooks, I may or may not want to repropose that site again next year. Maybe if I'll get trusted to be the coordinator.

# The First Amazing Event
My first scbool event as a student council organizer was the Chinese New Year event. I don't know why we have one, but we do somehow. It's our debut actually, we didn't have it previously. The tech division had two events there: our photo booth and a photography competition. I was the PIC of the photo booth. And I'll talk about it on my following blog post! ;)
