Wow, I haven't written any blog recently.. so eh, hello?

![First Rust program](/blog/image/first-rust.png)

Yay, I wrote my [first Rust program](https://github.com/DaringCuteSeal/askme-rs)â€”it's a rewrite of [AskMe Memorize](https://github.com/DaringCuteSeal/askme)! I don't know how but yeah, I did. I just sort of went ahead to write shit and apparently [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) is just so good I don't have to touch the internet to fix all my borrowing issues. 

I learned about variable borrowing yesterday and oh boy, how painful was that. I get the idea very well but somehow, following it in a program messes my head up. But yeah, I think that my current knowledge is enough to get me started.

In all seriousness, I can't believe I wrote a *decently good* program in 2 days with a language I've never used before (I'm just this dumb to the point where I'm proud but I've never done something like this). Rust is soo good! It feels super complete and when you code, you don't feel like you code aloneâ€”the linter guides youâ€”*It literally teaches you how to code*. Also, the compiler diagnostic is just so so clean, fancy, and it goes straight to the point. It also gives you ***feedback***!

Also, my favorite part is when I used the `assert_eq` macro out of nowhere (I don't understand anything about it) to catch my bug and I found the issue in like 5 seconds. Probably the quickest time I catched a bug, lol.

Hope that my past self from June last year is proud of me now ðŸ˜‘
