It's been like 2 weeks since I first entered my high school, and wheew, so many things (obviously).

I think that my most memorable moment is when I first strolled upstairs to get to my (temporary) homeroom. It felt almost unreal when I saw the whole school life on the stairs. Oh my god, I get to call myself a high schooler now. Feels weird, I don't think I'm ready for this. Me? Highschooler? ;-; And oh, look, lockers. Finally! *Now that's school*. Look at those seniors, oh god, I'm so short.

# The Unexpected First 4 Days
So to start off, my school introduction period lasted for 4 days. I remember it being 3 days in middle school :D And honestly, no words. It was fucking awesome. You see, in middle school, I had to finish some insane amount of assignments during those three days (+online bcz covid, ugh!). However, this time, there is virtually no task. AT ALLL. I didn't expect that at all, it's all just fun & gamesâ€”Literally! The seniors who guided us were also very fun and welcoming. They're pretty cool.

The first few days were filled with some seminars. Some are really boring tbh, but there's also a few that I really like. And then some more important announcement and school rules blah blah introduction.

On the fourth day, we played some games that involve getting yourself wet. The water on the field's floor gets a bit disgusting but that was crazy fun nevertheless. Though I definitely did not enjoy making my just-showered hair wet xD

# Mix-and-match?

We're the second ever batch in my high school to try out the new national curriculum. Basically, the biggest upgrade is that you get to mix-and match the subjects you want instead of picking only either the science field or the social studies field. That is awesome especially for this weird art but coding kid?!. Wait, no way. I actually liked the ministry's work this time. Good job, [Kemendikbud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education,_Culture,_Research,_and_Technology).

# Wait, Woah, That's Cozy.

Cushioned chairs. No wayyyyyyy I've never seen anything like this before. ~~Sleeping is gonna be more comfortable!~~ no, I sit at the very front. Also, the size of the table drawer is insane; I may be able to stuff in my whole backpack there. But that means less room for my feet, and also, the chair can't even be pulled close towards the table ðŸ˜­ But again, still very nice compared to my middle school.

# X
For some reason we don't write our homeroom names with decimal, we now got roman numerals instead and it's confusing my head a bit. Oh, and no more alphabets for homerooms, we use numbers now. I'm in X-5! Very wildly different than my middle school. But I should get used to it soon :P

# Lockers

As mentioned before, lockers. I don't think that I can live without them anymore. Lockers are cool asf! Never had any before at school. I have so many things that I may need to bring on certain days, but unfortunately my brain sucks. It can't remember everything. My locker is literally a life saverâ€”I can just put those things to my locker! And you are actually allowed to put all of your books there, but I don't think that I'd do that because I may need them at home.

# Nice Homeroom

Nice, I got some close friends here (I've not had any irl ultra-close friend in my homeroom for like 2 years). We all got along pretty quickly, I really love the vibe here.


# Wild Teachers

All my teachers are fun asf. Except for one though, my biology teacher. He's like.. very strict and not chill xD. Well I haven't had many bio classes yet so who knows. Ugh, I love biology. Such a bummer.


# Hm, More Exciting Things?

My school has a yearly competition for younger students, and we get to be part of the commitee. I registered myself already, hopefully I'll get accepted.

Also, I'm joining the so-called "IT Club" (I think you just learn C/C++ there :\\) and the poster & drawing extracurricular.

And I'm gonna have to work my ass off trying to join as many competitions as I could. I need those good good tickets for scholarship, would be very niceâ€”considering my broke ass self LOL. But anyways.. I'm both scared and excited at the same time, and a bit anxious. I just hope that everything will go well. If things don't.. I hope that I'll know why.
