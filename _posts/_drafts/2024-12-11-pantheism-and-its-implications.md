Decided to write again after some existential crisis, ha! This time, I'd like to explore a bit further about the interesting implications of ideas in my personal pantheism (not the ones that purely come from other philosophers). I don't think that I've written anything about my personal belief, so I'll probably talk about that too.


# About Pantheism

First and foremost, we talk about what Pantheism _really_ is. Its actual definition is quite a vague one, but it is generally accepted as the belief that God is present in all natural things.[^1] It also rarely refers to the belief in many or all gods, although this is more precisely labeled as omnism. The term "pantheism" is quite a modern one—its adjective, "pantheist" was coined by Irish Deist John Toland in his book, _Socinianism Truly Stated_ in 1705. "Pantheism" was then first used in 1709 by one of his opponents.[^2] However, pantheistic ideas have emerged since long time ago. It dates as far back as the Upanishads scriptures—one of the roots of Hinduism, the _Tao Te Ching_ scripture—foundational work of Taoism, and Zeno of Citium—founder of the Stoic school of philosophy.[^3]

It wasn't feasible to express pantheistic beliefs when Christianity was enforced as the state religion of the Roman empire. Several pantheists were marginalized, executed, and suppressed. In the 16th and 17th centuries, though, religious tolerance started to spread in the Europe and pantheism was able to flourish again, starting with Baruch Spinoza in one of his work, _Ethics_. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, pantheism started to spread in Germany with Lessing, Goethe, and Hegel. In Britain, pantheistic idea was expressed by several poets—Wordsworth, Keats, and Shelley. In the USA, Transcendentalism emerged, carrying also some pantheistic ideas.[^3]

From the way that Pantheism was spread and expressed, we know that Pantheism isn't intrinsically some kind of philosophy that stands on its own—but rather, a quite diverse family of distinct ideas and beliefs that all lean towards the idea that the universe is intrinsically divine—without the engagement of anthropomorphism, since pantheism doesn't really talk about anthropomorphic deity. It is one of the elements of several great school of philosophies and religions. It is also closely related to humans' innate wonder and curiosity towards the universe. There are a few varieties of pantheism, [most of which you can read here](https://www.pantheism.net/paul/variety1.htm).

Obviously, believing in some pantheistic ideas doesn't make you a pantheist. In fact, people rarely identify themselves as a pantheist. I just find that my beliefs are pantheistic—and since I'm not quite an atheist nor an agnostic either, I'd be glad to identify myself as a pantheist.


# My Personal Pantheism

## Little bit of Background

My parents are legally Buddhists, and so am I. I did go to Vihāra when I was little, but I don't think I absorbed more than just the moral values from it. _Heck, I didn't even understand the prayers. Wasn't written in a language I understand._ Hehe. At home, I don't think I'm taught much about Buddhism. But of course, yeah, I am taught about morality and ethics.

I attend a Christian school—have been for the past 10 years. I know quite some bits about Christianity, but let's just say that I don't really resonate with it—or any religion for that matter. The thought of having to believe one school of thing and not able to question it or make my own conclusions is a bit terrifying for me.

Anyways, I was left here just wondering about the world on my own, and it was at its peak when I was 11 or 12. Things really took turn when you start to grow up and realize that you don't really have any spiritual ground. I questioned about the reality and God a lot back then—that was the time when I got into philosophy.

I got my hands on a short book about Stoicism in 2022. It felt so relatable and understandable at some uncanny level. Since then, I made Stoicism my basis for pretty much everything. Later on, I discovered several categories of beliefs—including pantheism. I realized that some of my worldviews align with that, so I stopped identifying myself as an agnostic and leaned towards pantheism. 

Of several quotes I discovered, there's one that quite struck me:

> We are not humans experiencing this universe, rather, we are this universe experiencing a human being.

The part of me that understands how most people view this world screamed in terror, as that sentence don't quite make sense in any level—I'd even regard it as being quite absurd. However, this new worldview clicked for the _true_ me. It's kinda odd, that some quote changed my entire perspective of this world by 180 degrees overnight. I found that this belief is quite comforting as it helped me answer some not-so-trivial questions about reality and cope with sad truths—that would otherwise, well, stay pathetic without pantheism to back them up.


## Intro to My Pantheism, in Particular

If all beliefs are correct in their own ways, why not seek the parts that feel right to you and combine them into one? Did that and I got a belief you can categorize as [scientific pantheism](https://pantheism.net/beliefs/).

As with the point before: we are ✨ this universe ✨ experiencing a human body! Am I saying that you and me are gods? Not really. I don't want to mess up the definition of "God" as most people use it to refer to a personal, anthropomorphic God. It's just that we are this universe—no more, no less. With a [materialistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism) and [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) view this would sound quite right.

Not saying that we are no more than waves and particles interacting. I mean, we are those, but humans are so unique that they see bizarre things like friendship bracelets—which are no more than threads weaved to make a circular thing that rests on your arm—as more than what it is. Humans seek meanings, and so we give them. We never "find" meanings, we make them. Most of us would agree that all of us are more than just waves and particles interacting. We make the meaning.

Once, there wasn't you. There were just, well, everything else. But one day everything collapsed into a singular YOU! And you lived since then as a part of this big picture, honoring your role in this universe while being guided by the interactions of everything. After you die, you will get recycled back into other things. And you will once again be this universe without your former identity. Remember, you are only temporarily in your body. Realize that you are actually not you, you are this universe. Don't be selfish, buddy. Live life like you're living life as the whole life itself.


## More of my Ideas (Like, The Basis of All)

My original compilation of philosophies was written as 10 main points which I later condensed and revised:

1. The universe is defined as everything—yourself, your family, friends, things, and the things that come after it like the state of mind. It's your little heart that you can talk to. You can call anything universe, and universe is everything. It's not sacred, you can write it without uppercase.
2. This universe consists of chains of processes that lead to other processes. There is no intrinsic magic or intention behind anything. Coincidences are feelings from side effect of humans' innate pattern-seeking nature. (determinism)
3. Meaning is not inherently possessed by things—rather, it only exists in our minds and it is subjective from individual to individual.
4. Life is not serious. It is not meant to be taken seriously, but you can if you want to. At the end, your matter (like, physical matter) will get recycled for other things. All that matters is what you do when you are alive because all that we have is the present. The past and future are elusive myths that come no more from belief that they actually happened or would happen.
5. The things outside this reality, e.g deity that exists outside and not bound within this universe may or may not exist. Just because we cannot proof it, doesn't mean you can arbitrarily believe in that or dismiss it.
6. Everything is a life experience. To enjoy life, you need to be grateful of your fate. That also means you have to be grateful of suffering. Without suffering, there will be no pleasure. To live life, you need problems. Don't forget that bad experiences are also experiences worth getting in your life.

Even though I originally wrote them before I knew anything about pantheism, they still sound pantheistic—and that's what I found quite divine :P

# Pantheism as a Basis of Morality

Now we get to the challenge. Can pantheism be a basis of morality?

Seeing that everything is divine and nothing really has meaning besides what we give is quite daunting—that's something I agree with. And I had found some interesting arguments to why pantheism may not be a good approach in morality, as seen with this article by Rob Fennell, [A moral challenge to pantheism](https://creedalandlovingit.wordpress.com/2017/11/04/a-moral-challenge-to-pantheism/).

Here's an interesting bit:

> If the divine universe is just being itself when human beings murder, torture, and maim, there is no point and no meaning in calling these actions bad, wrong, or immoral. They are morally neutral—not good and not bad. They are just what the universe does. Once again, it is all divine. The world is divine, and what happens in the world is divine, and all the animals and trees and sky and rocks and people are divine. And when someone does something that most people would call “bad,” those who call it “bad” are simply unaware that the person doing that so-called “wrong” thing is fully part of the divine-universe-being-divine, being “God.”

Some pantheistic philosophies, like Stoicism, would argue that everything that had happened is neither good nor bad—it's all our interpretation. Therefore, none of our actions are intrinsically good or bad. And I would agree to some extent.

Maybe it's wild—I think that people who think that murder _is_ good as _not more righteous_ than people who think that murder _is_ bad. Right and wrong is, by nature, a subjective human thing. The end. Pantheism doesn't say anything about that anymore. Even though I personally believe that murder is wrong (morality reasoning below) <small>(this sounds like a crazy thing to write)</small>, I'd also like to think of those who can't see that fact similarly to us. For example, what about people with personality disorders who can't really tell it's wrong? It's not really their fault.

But that also comes to the question of what we _should_ govern. What rules do we make? Should we convince people otherwise? If everything can be both right and wrong then why do rules exist and how do we even make them?!

Let's be realistic folks, rules don't govern what's right—rules govern what _most_ people think of as right. That's it. We can't ever agree on anything. Each human individual is unique with their own bizarre perspectives that we can't really see and all perspectives are [quite correct if backed up with reasoning](/blog/we-are-all-right-in-our-own-way). The most logical thing to do is to make rules that benefit the most people (agreed by most people), since that's what works to preserve our existence anyways.

But from our first point from Stoicism—that we have power over our own interpretations—we can assure ourselves that we _have the willpower_ to try to find right and wrong things to do, as meaning-seeking humans. But what would be a good basis for this? In my opinion, the sentence that "we are all one" implies a lot—such as that other people (who, in some sense, are also part of us) also share some feelings like us—evidently shown as they behave like us. They have feelings, they have wills. They have strengths and imperfections. Realizing both of those things, we can say that helping other people is just helping ourselves. Hurting others mean we are hurting ourselves.

Mm, how I put that reminds me of a short story by Andy Weir, [The Egg](https://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html).

Anyway, yeah, that's just empathy. Our very gift. I blabbed too much, huh? Empathy is the ultimate source of morality and it is amplified even more with the view that other people are also us.

As to, "should we convince people otherwise?" I think the answer is yes. Personally, I feel open to people correcting me so I can gain insights into more things, so I just assume that others would like that as well.
