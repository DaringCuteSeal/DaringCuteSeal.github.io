Abandonment.

They know that you're there, they love you.

But they unintentionally leave you behind, somehow.

Unfortunately, they are them, and so youâ€”who's you, cannot do anything.

And then you try to chase them, but they run further away from you.

Time goes by, you're exhausted.

You decided to just sit back and relax.

And learned to respect them.

(they're just enjoying their silly little life.)

What kind of right are you supposed to have?

Maybe they are not the special one, just yet another spark of your life.

_Because no one will ever be yours anyways._

Weird to think that you can have someone, right?

And so you let them go.

Maybe you've done enough.

You looked at your palms, you took a deep breath.

It's lonely in this skull, isn't it?

But it's alright,

you'll always have yourself. Always.

Look in front of you.
