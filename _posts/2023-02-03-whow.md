Wow, Whow. That little script with a weird name ([this guy](https://github.com/ezntek/whow) said that) that I wrote as a joke and satire but useful app. Yeah, I remember that afternoon. I was sitting cozily on my chair attending the computer extracurricular when I got pissed off because we had to use [Trello](https://trello.com) and not write a to-do app instead (that wasn't a coding extracurricular, it's not their fault, and I shouldn't be pissed off anyway). I then wrote my own experimental to-do manager app with minimum shell scripting knowledge—It worked! Whow is now a 1340-lined ultra messy bash script.

I never expected anyone to like this thing. But somehow, there are 2 rewrites of Whow as of now - [github.com/ezntek/whow](https://github.com/ezntek/whow) (which I contributed to) and [github.com/jumps-are-op/whowp](https://github.com/jumps-are-op/whowp)—which is really cool!

So, as mentioned previously, I worked with [Eason](https://ezntek.github.io/about/) (thank you!) to rewrite Whow in Python [It's available at his GitHub](https://github.com/ezntek/whow). It was tedious as first as I know nothing about advanced correct workflow of creating a Python software, but after a while, I felt more comfortable helping. And yes, I only wrote like 5% of the app, I'm trying to grasp anything other than shell right now. I never really bothered to learn Python this much because shell scripting exists and for an average programmer who got into coding again because they switched to Linux, it's good enough for me.
